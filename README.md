Sprint Review and Retrospective 

What is important to know from a software development perspective about this topic and its relationship with traditional operating systems?

From a software development perspective, it is important to understand that cloud platforms differ from traditional operating systems in several ways. For example, cloud platforms are designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and distributed, which means that software developers must take these characteristics into account when designing and developing cloud-based applications. Furthermore, cloud platforms typically provide a wide range of services and tools that can be used to build, deploy, and manage cloud-based applications, which can help to streamline the development process.

How does developing the software for each platform differ? How is it similar?

Developing software for cloud platforms differs from traditional operating systems in several ways. For example, cloud platforms typically require developers to design their applications as a collection of small, independent microservices that can be easily deployed and managed in a distributed environment. In contrast, traditional operating systems often involve building large, monolithic applications that are tightly coupled and difficult to scale.
However, there are also similarities between developing software for cloud platforms and traditional operating systems. Both approaches require a strong understanding of software design principles, programming languages, and development tools. Additionally, both approaches require developers to write high-quality, maintainable, and reliable code.


What does it mean for a cloud-based system to be serverless? How does this influence the software development process?

A serverless cloud-based system is one in which the developer does not have to worry about managing or provisioning servers. Instead, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically scales resources up or down based on the application's needs. This approach can significantly simplify the development process, as developers can focus on writing application code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
However, developing for a serverless environment also requires a different approach to application design. Developers must create their applications as a set of independent functions that can be invoked on demand. This means that they need to design their code to be stateless and able to handle concurrency, which can be a significant departure from traditional application design.

How does architecting applications for the cloud differ from traditional operating systems? Are there advantages to this method and, if so, what are they?

Architecting applications for the cloud involves designing them to be distributed, scalable, and resilient. This typically involves breaking applications down into small, independent microservices that can be easily scaled and deployed. In contrast, traditional operating systems often involve building large, monolithic applications that are tightly coupled and difficult to scale.
The advantages of cloud-based application design include the ability to easily scale applications up or down based on demand, and the ability to easily deploy applications to multiple geographic regions. Additionally, cloud-based applications can be more resilient to failure, as they are designed to automatically recover from failures and distribute workload across multiple nodes.

What are the cost differences between traditional and cloud-based operating platforms?

The cost differences between traditional and cloud-based operating platforms can vary widely depending on the specific use case. In general, cloud-based platforms can offer significant cost savings, as they allow organizations to pay only for the resources they use, rather than having to invest in and maintain their own physical infrastructure. Additionally, cloud-based platforms can often offer more flexible pricing models and the ability to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand.
